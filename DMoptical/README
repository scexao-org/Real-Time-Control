    test
        sdk_test                        SDK test script (uses bmc_ltest tool)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the driver, the library, and the test tool:
    cd src
    make
After this step there will be three new directories:
    tmp/
        bmc_mdlib.o
        bmc_ltest.o
    bin/
        bmc_mdrv.ko                     driver kernel module for running kernel
        bmc_ltest                       SDK test tool
    lib/
        libbmcmd.a                      BMC mirror driver SDK library

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the driver module in the kernel:
    cd bin
    sudo insmod bmc_mdrv.ko

NOTE!   The /dev/bmc_mdrvN file has limited permissions!
        You must
            sudo chmod o+rw /dev/bmc_mdrv*
        in order to access the hardware w/o root privileges.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exercise the hardware, driver, and SDK:
    cd test
    ./sdk_test

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bmc_ltest.c test tool exercises all the SDK API calls and illustrates
the proper call sequence for operating the mirror driver board.

The tool/Makefile shows the necessary library invocation for linking the
SDK into any user-specific software.

===========================================================================

NOTE:
For larger mirror modules the PC may deliver data faster than the hardware
can write to the D/A units.  Inside the driver there is a spin delay capability
which will slow the data transfer.  The bmc_ltest tool can be used to set this
driver spin delay using, e.g.,
  bmc_ltest -D N
where N is the desired spin cycles between PCI write cycles.  The default N is
0.
