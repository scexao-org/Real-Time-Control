                       DPIO2 Device Driver for 
                    Linux 2.6.x Operating System

                           Release 2.4.13

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------
  As supplied, this software distribution is intended to be used with:
     VMETRO DPIO2       PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC), ECO A3-A6, B0
     VMETRO DPIO2 66MHz PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC), ECO A0 / B0

  on x86-linux-2.6.x platforms.

  The DPIO2 Linux Device Driver version 2.4.13 has been tested on the following
  platforms:

  Hardware                Linux
  Dual XEON 2.0GHz PC     Fedora 2, 2.6.8-1.521smp kernel
  Dual XEON 2.0GHz PC     Fedora 2, standard 2.6.9 kernel

  In addition the driver can be ported to other architectures running
  Linux 2.6 kernels.



IMPORTANT: The DPIO2 modules should have the most up-to-date FPGA code.
           Please contact VMETRO to check that your DPIO2 module has
           the correct FPGA code.

           When version 2.4.13 of the driver was released (may 2006):

           Version B0513 was the most up-to-date FPGA code for 
           DPIO2 modules with ECO Bx/Cx.

           Version A0101 was the most up-to-date FPGA code for 
           DPIO2 66MHz modules with ECO Ax.

           Version B0103 was the most up-to-date FPGA code for 
           DPIO2 66MHz modules with ECO Bx.



DISTRIBUTIONS:
---------------

  There are two types of DPIO2 device driver distributions for Linux :
  1) Binary distribution Part.no: DP2-DRV-LNX-B
  2) Source code distribution Part.no: DP2-DRV-LNX-S

  The DPIO2 device driver binary distribution includes precompiled user space
  binaries for x86 with gcc version 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7).
  The kernel space module is included as source code in order to compile with
  different Linux kernel versions.

  The DPIO2 Binary distribution includes precompiled user space binaries for
  x86. The kernel space code is distribute as source code in order to compile
  with different kernel versions.

  The DPIO2 Source distribution includes source code for both user and kernel
  space.



SUPPORT:
---------

  A valid DPIO2-Linux driver (v2.4.13) license provides the user with the 
  rights to receive DPIO2 specific support for any x86 linux platforms.
  The DPIO2 x86 Linux driver license does not include rights to require
  Linux specific support from VMETRO.



RESTRICTIONS:
-------------

  DPIO2_CMD_DMA_ABORT / DPIO2_CMD_FLUSH_ON_DMA_ABORT_SELECT
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  Data may always be lost when using the DPIO2_CMD_DMA_ABORT command.
  The reason is that the internal FIFOs on the DPIO2 module are always 
  flushed, regardless of the mode selected by 
  DPIO2_CMD_FLUSH_ON_DMA_ABORT_SELECT.

  
  DPIO2_CMD_EOT_ENABLE
  --------------------
  When a DMA transfer is stopped by the EOT mechanism, data may be lost.
  The reason is that the internal FIFOs on the DPIO2 module are flushed.

  When the DMA controller is configured to jump to the next descriptor 
  on EOT (DPIO2_CMD_CONTINUE_ON_EOT_SELECT), data will only be lost if EOT
  happens during the transfer associated with the last descriptor 
  in the DMA chain.
                



KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

  There are no known bugs.
